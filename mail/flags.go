Flag "P" (passed): the user has resent/forwarded/bounced this message to someone else.

Flag "S" (seen): the user has viewed this message, though perhaps he didn't read all the way through it.
Flag "T" (trashed): the user has moved this message to the trash; the trash will be emptied by a later user action.
Flag "D" (draft): the user considers this message a draft; toggled at user discretion.
